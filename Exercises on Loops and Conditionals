Exercises on Loops and Conditionals:
1. Print the First 10 Natural Numbers:
Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Sum of First N Natural Numbers:
Write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to n (input by the user).
3. Print a Pattern (Triangle):
Print the following pattern using a loop:

4. Factorial of a Number:
Take an input number n and calculate the factorial of n using a for loop.
(Factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120)
5. Count the Number of Digits in a Number:
Write a while loop that counts the number of digits in a given number.
(For example, the number 12345 has 5 digits.)
6. Print All Prime Numbers Between 1 and 100:
Use nested loops and conditional statements to find all prime numbers in the range 1 to 100.
7. Reverse a Given Number:
Write a while loop to reverse a number input by the user.
(For example, if the input is 1234, the output should be 4321.)
8. Sum of Digits of a Number:
Take an integer input and use a while loop to find the sum of its digits.
(For example, for input 123, the sum of digits is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.)
9. Multiplication Table:
Use a loop to print the multiplication table for a given number n.
10. Check if a Number is a Palindrome:
A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. Write a program to check if a given number is a palindrome.
(For example, 121 is a palindrome, but 123 is not.)
11. Fibonacci Sequence:
Write a program to print the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
(Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...)
12. Check if a Year is a Leap Year:
Write a program that takes a year as input and checks whether it is a leap year or not.
(A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, except when it's divisible by 400.)
13. Find the Largest and Smallest Numbers in a List:
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and finds the largest and smallest numbers in the list using loops.
14. Print All Odd Numbers in a Given Range:
Write a for loop that prints all odd numbers between two numbers a and b (input by the user).
15. Guessing Game:
Write a simple guessing game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number. The program should give hints such as "too high" or "too low" based on the guesses.
