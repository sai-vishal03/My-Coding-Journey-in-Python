# My-Coding-Journey-in-Python

To help you master coding from a beginner to an expert level, starting with Python and progressing to more advanced topics like Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Dynamic Programming, and competitive programming platforms like Leetcode and Codeforces, here's a structured plan:

Phase 1: Mastering the Basics of Python
Setup Your Environment:

Install Python and a code editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or PyCharm.
Familiarize yourself with the Python Interpreter and Jupyter Notebooks for practicing code.
Python Syntax & Fundamentals:

Topics to Learn:
Variables and Data Types (int, float, string, list, tuple, set, dictionary)
Basic I/O operations (input, print)
Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
Loops (for, while)
Functions (def, return, arguments)
Exception Handling (try, except)
File I/O (reading from and writing to files)
Practice: Solve simple problems like calculating factorial, sum of a list, etc., on platforms like Hackerrank or W3Schools.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Topics to Learn:
Classes and Objects
Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation
Magic/Dunder Methods (__init__, __str__, etc.)
Practice: Create simple programs using OOP concepts like a BankAccount class.
Modules and Libraries:

Learn about importing libraries and working with Python's standard libraries (os, sys, math, datetime, etc.).
Phase 2: Intermediate Python and Problem Solving
Data Structures in Python:

Learn:
Lists, Stacks, Queues
Linked Lists
Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
Hashing (Dictionaries in Python)
Graphs (Adjacency Lists, Matrices)
Heaps and Priority Queues
Practice: Start solving basic problems on Leetcode or Codeforces.
Algorithms:

Sorting & Searching Algorithms:
Learn basic algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search.
Practice algorithm-based questions, starting from easy to medium level.
Recursion:

Understand recursion with problems like factorial, Fibonacci series, and more complex recursive algorithms.
Practice recursive solutions on coding platforms.
Phase 3: Advanced DSA and Competitive Programming
Dynamic Programming (DP):

Learn the fundamentals of DP, including:
Memoization and Tabulation
Common DP problems like Longest Increasing Subsequence, Knapsack problem, etc.
Practice: Solve Leetcode medium and hard problems on DP.
Greedy Algorithms:

Understand how to approach problems using the greedy method (e.g., Huffman coding, activity selection).
Practice greedy algorithm problems on Leetcode and Codeforces.
Graph Algorithms:

Learn graph traversal techniques:
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS)
Practice problems like finding shortest paths (Dijkstra’s algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm).
Phase 4: Competitive Programming
Leetcode and Codeforces:

Focus on solving daily problems on Leetcode and participate in contests.
Use Codeforces for competitive programming to improve speed and accuracy.
Learn about problem-solving strategies used in contests like:
Binary Search on Answer
Divide and Conquer
Mastering Time and Space Complexity:

Focus on analyzing the complexity of your solutions (Big O notation).
Optimize solutions by reducing time and space complexities.
Phase 5: Mock Interviews & Challenges
Mock Interviews:

Take mock interviews using platforms like Pramp or InterviewBit.
Focus on technical interview problems similar to what you might encounter in FAANG companies.
Advanced Topics (Optional):

Learn advanced topics like Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, and advanced graph theory if you aim to master competitive programming.
Additional Tips:
Consistency is Key: Code every day, even if it’s for a short time.
Track Progress: Use platforms like Leetcode or GitHub to track your solutions and improvements.
Join Communities: Engage with coding communities (Reddit, Stack Overflow) to discuss problems and learn from others.
