My code:
n=int(input())
n1=int(input())
n2=int(input())
print(f"The largest number is {n}") if (n > n1 and n > n2) else print(f"The largest number is {n1}") if (n1 > n2) else print(f"The largest number is {n2}")

Optimized Code:
python
Copy code
# Take three numbers as input
n1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
n2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
n3 = int(input("Enter the third number: "))

# Find the largest number
if n1 >= n2 and n1 >= n3:
    largest = n1
elif n2 >= n1 and n2 >= n3:
    largest = n2
else:
    largest = n3

print(f"The largest number is {largest}")
Explanation:
Improved Readability: The if-elif-else structure makes it clear which number is being compared and assigned.
Equal Numbers: Using >= ensures that if two or more numbers are equal, the code will correctly identify one as the largest.
This version of the code is more readable and handles the comparison more clearly.

Task: Find the Largest Number Among Three Numbers
Logic:
Take three numbers as input from the user.
Compare the three numbers to determine which one is the largest.
Print the largest number.
Expected Input:
Number 1: 10
Number 2: 25
Number 3: 15
Expected Output:
csharp
Copy code
The largest number is 25
Another Example:

Number 1: 3
Number 2: 1
Number 3: 2
Expected Output:

csharp
Copy code
The largest number is 3
