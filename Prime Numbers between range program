Print All Prime Numbers Between 1 and 100 program:

# Get the range from the user
start = int(input("Enter the start of the range: "))
end = int(input("Enter the end of the range: "))

# Ensure the start is at least 2, as numbers less than 2 are not prime
if start < 2:
    start = 2

# Iterate through each number in the range
for n in range(start, end + 1):
    if n < 2:
        continue  # Skip numbers less than 2 (though we already ensured start >= 2)
    
    # Check if n is a prime number
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            break  # n is not a prime number if it is divisible by i
    else:
        # If no divisors were found, n is a prime number
        print(n, end=" ")

### **Task 6: Print All Prime Numbers Between 1 and 100**

#### **Logic:**
- A prime number is a number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself.
- For each number `i` from 1 to 100, check if it is prime:
  1. For `i = 2` to `i = 100`, check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
  2. Use a loop to check divisibility by numbers from `2` to `sqrt(i)` (this reduces the number of checks).

#### **Steps:**
1. Loop through numbers from 1 to 100.
2. For each number, check if it is prime by testing divisibility.
3. If it is prime, print the number.

#### **Expected Output:**
```
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97
```
