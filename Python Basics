Step 3: Python Basics
In Python, variables can hold different types of data, and their type is determined automatically by the value assigned.

python
Copy code
# Variables
name = "Sai Vishal"  # String: A sequence of characters
age = 22             # Integer: A whole number
height = 5.9         # Float: A number that can have decimals
is_student = True    # Boolean: A value that can be either True or False

# Print the values and types
print(name, type(name))         # Outputs the value of 'name' and its type (str)
print(age, type(age))           # Outputs the value of 'age' and its type (int)
print(height, type(height))     # Outputs the value of 'height' and its type (float)
print(is_student, type(is_student))  # Outputs the value of 'is_student' and its type (bool)
Step 2: Basic Operations
Python supports various arithmetic operations that can be performed on numbers.

python
Copy code
# Arithmetic operations
a = 10  # Assigning the value 10 to variable 'a'
b = 3   # Assigning the value 3 to variable 'b'

# Addition
print(a + b)   # Outputs 13, which is the result of adding 10 and 3

# Subtraction
print(a - b)   # Outputs 7, which is the result of subtracting 3 from 10

# Multiplication
print(a * b)   # Outputs 30, which is the result of multiplying 10 and 3

# Division
print(a / b)   # Outputs 3.33333, which is the result of dividing 10 by 3

# Integer Division
print(a // b)  # Outputs 3, which is the result of integer division (floor division), discarding the fractional part

# Modulus (remainder)
print(a % b)   # Outputs 1, which is the remainder when 10 is divided by 3

# Exponentiation
print(a ** b)  # Outputs 1000, which is 10 raised to the power of 3 (10 * 10 * 10)
Step 3: Input from the User
You can take user input using the input() function. It captures everything as a string, so you often need to convert it to the appropriate type.

python
Copy code
# Taking input from the user
name = input("Enter your name: ")           # Captures user input for 'name'
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))         # Converts the user input to an integer for 'age'
height = float(input("Enter your height: ")) # Converts the user input to a float for 'height'

# Outputting a formatted string using f-string
print(f"Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old and {height} feet tall.")
Summary
Variables in Python don't need explicit type declarations; they are inferred from the assigned values.
Basic arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integer division, modulus, and exponentiation.
User input is handled using the input() function, and type conversion is done to ensure the input values are used correctly in calculations or logic.
This structure makes Python both powerful and easy to use for beginners.
