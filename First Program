Step 2: Writing Your First Python Program

Hello World: Open your code editor (VS Code or PyCharm), create a new file, and name it hello.py. In this file, type the following:
python
Copy code
print("Hello, World!")
Run the Program:
If you're using VS Code, you can run the program by opening the terminal in VS Code (View -> Terminal) and typing:
bash
Copy code
"python hello.py"

In PyCharm, simply right-click on the file and select "Run" or use the play button at the top right corner.
You should see the output: Hello, World!
