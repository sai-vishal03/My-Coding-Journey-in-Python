My code:
#find prime or not.
n=int(input())
if n<2:
    print(f"{n} is not a prime number")
else:
    for i in range(2,n):
        if n%i==0:
            print(f"{n} is not a prime number")
            break
    else:
        print(f"{n} is a prime number")

#find prime numbers in a given range.
# Get the range from the user
start = int(input("Enter the start of the range: "))
end = int(input("Enter the end of the range: "))

# Ensure the start is at least 2, as numbers less than 2 are not prime
if start < 2:
    start = 2

# Iterate through each number in the range
for n in range(start, end + 1):
    if n < 2:
        continue  # Skip numbers less than 2 (though we already ensured start >= 2)
    
    # Check if n is a prime number
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            break  # n is not a prime number if it is divisible by i
    else:
        # If no divisors were found, n is a prime number
        print(n, end=" ")

Optimized Code:
import math
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if n < 2:
    print(f"{n} is not a prime number")
else:
    is_prime = True
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break    
    if is_prime:
        print(f"{n} is a prime number")
    else:
        print(f"{n} is not a prime number")
Explanation:
Square Root Optimization: Checking divisibility only up to the square root of n (int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1) reduces the number of iterations needed.
Readability: The is_prime flag clearly indicates the primality of the number and improves readability.
Mathematical Import: The math module is used to compute the square root.

Task: Check for Prime Number
Logic:
Take a number as input from the user.
Check if the number is a prime number.
A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself.
For checking, you need to test if the number is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of the number.
Print whether the number is prime or not.
Expected Input:
Number: 29
Expected Output:
csharp
Copy code
29 is a prime number
Another Example:

Number: 10
Expected Output:

csharp
Copy code
10 is not a prime number
