Factorial Number program:

n=int(input())
f=1
for i in range(1,n+1):
        f=f*i
print(f)


Suggestions for Improvement:
You can add a check to handle the case where n = 0, since the factorial of 0 is defined as 1.
Variable names like f can be more descriptive for better readability, e.g., factorial.
Optimized Version:
python
Copy code
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Factorial of 0 is 1
factorial = 1

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    factorial *= i

print(f"Factorial of {n} is {factorial}")
Explanation of Changes:
Added a prompt message when asking for input.
Used factorial as the variable name to make the code more readable.
If you want to handle negative numbers or other invalid inputs, you can add input validation.
